A no code, multi-player digital garden builder.



## What Is A Digtial Garden?

> The term “digital garden” is not well-defined. In general, it is a collection of thoughts, unfinished projects, links, and much more. However, it can be different and wholly unique to the individual. I would like to broaden the term to enclose any sort of website that allows you to truly browse without viewing posts chronologically. Digital gardens, collections, spaces — call it what you want.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) describes [her digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) as an "An open collection of notes, resources, sketches, and explorations I'm currently cultivating. Some notes are Seedlings, some are budding, and some are fully grown Evergreen."
