Each Digital Garden, which is deployed as a static HTML site -- see [[garden-client]] -- needs a Garden Server. [DigitalGardenBuilder.app](https://digitalgardenbuilder.app/) is an example of a Garden Server. This is developer-facing documentation about running your own. It is not neccassary to do so.

## Installation

Reasons you may want to do this:

- You're contributing to the development of this open source project.
  - Thank you!
  - The simplest way to get started is with [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Shelob9/digitial-garden-builder).
- You want to add your own features.
  - Awesome. It's a [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) app.
  - [It would be cool to extract the routes to a seperate package, you could use in a Next.js app.](https://github.com/Shelob9/garden-cms-test-data/issues/11)
  
 Please see [the server's README](https://github.com/Shelob9/digitial-garden-builder/blob/main/server/README.md) for more details.
