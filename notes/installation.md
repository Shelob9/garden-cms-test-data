# Installing The Digital Garden Builder

The goal is to make this a "click buttons, fill out some fields, and you're done setup process." For now, probably don't install this, but [see the README](https://github.com/Shelob9/garden-cms/blob/main/README.md) for how. 

The plan is to have at least two options:

- Point and click install, no code required.
  - [Fill out this form for early access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceXRwG_NQ-5sy1lcP613uS_BH2H1JqhuGOzOWbai7XClK3Cw/viewform)
  - This will require a Github account.
  - Support for self-hosted git, such as [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) or storing data on a [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or similar would be great.
- Self-hosted
  - Most likely this means running your own [[notes-server]].
