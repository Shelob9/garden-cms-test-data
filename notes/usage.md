## Logging In

To log into your digital garden, go to `/login`, and click the "Login With Github" link.

## Writing Notes
  
Notes are written in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

When you are logged in to your garden, you can click the "edit" link at the top of each note to get to the editor for that note.

### Linking Notes

If you want to create a link between notes, use double brackets around that link's slug. For example, if you have a note with the slug "infinite-lumens", you use `[[infinite-lumens]]`.

### Saving Your Note

When you are done editing your note, click the "Save" button. Each version of your note is saved in Github.

## Create A New Note

To create a new note click the "New Note" button in the top navigation. This will take you to a screen that asks you to give the note a title. Add a title -- you can change it later -- and click the "Create" button. You are now editing your new, empty note.

## View Graph Of Note Links

To visualize the relationship of your notes, click the button in the top bar that looks like some inter-connected nodes and has the title "Show Graph Visualization". You can drag the nodes around.
